    "We can think of the KL divergence as distance metric (although it isn’t symmetric) that quantifies the difference between two probability distributions. One common scenario where this is useful is when we are working with a complex distribution. Rather than working with the distribution directly, we can make our life easier by using another distribution with well known properties (i.e. normal distribution) that does a decent job of describing the data. In other words, we can use the KL divergence to tell whether a poisson distribution or a normal distribution is a better at approximating the data. \n",

    "**Part 1 - Train the Discriminator**\n",
    "\n",

    "probability of correctly classifying a given input as real or fake. In\n",
    "terms of Goodfellow, we wish to “update the discriminator by ascending\n",
    "its stochastic gradient”. Practically, we want to maximize\n",
    "$log(D(x)) + log(1-D(G(z)))$. Due to the separate mini-batch\n",
    "suggestion from ganhacks, we will calculate this in two steps. First, we\n",
    "will construct a batch of real samples from the training set, forward\n",
    "pass through $D$, calculate the loss ($log(D(x))$), then\n",
    "calculate the gradients in a backward pass. Secondly, we will construct\n",
    "a batch of fake samples with the current generator, forward pass this\n",
    "batch through $D$, calculate the loss ($log(1-D(G(z)))$),\n",
    "and *accumulate* the gradients with a backward pass. Now, with the\n",
    "gradients accumulated from both the all-real and all-fake batches, we\n",
    "call a step of the Discriminator’s optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2 - Train the Generator**\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated in the original paper, we want to train the Generator by\n",
    "minimizing $log(1-D(G(z)))$ in an effort to generate better fakes.\n",
    "As mentioned, this was shown by Goodfellow to not provide sufficient\n",
    "gradients, especially early in the learning process. As a fix, we\n",
    "instead wish to maximize $log(D(G(z)))$. In the code we accomplish\n",
    "this by: classifying the Generator output from Part 1 with the\n",
    "Discriminator, computing G’s loss *using real labels as GT*, computing\n",
    "G’s gradients in a backward pass, and finally updating G’s parameters\n",
    "with an optimizer step. It may seem counter-intuitive to use the real\n",
    "labels as GT labels for the loss function, but this allows us to use the\n",
    "$log(x)$ part of the BCELoss (rather than the $log(1-x)$\n",
    "part) which is exactly what we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will do some statistic reporting and at the end of each\n",
    "epoch we will push our fixed_noise batch through the generator to\n",
    "visually track the progress of G’s training. The training statistics\n",
    "reported are:\n",
